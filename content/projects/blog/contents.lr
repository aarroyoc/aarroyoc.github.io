Since 2015 I have a blog talking about programming and software, and some offtopic. I write in Spanish and the CMS is custom made, currently called [Diario](https://github.com/aarroyoc/diario) made in Rust with Rocket and Diesel.

Some of the code example of the blog are hosted also on GitHub: [https://github.com/aarroyoc/blog-ejemplos](https://github.com/aarroyoc/blog-ejemplos)

Previous iterations of the blog run under Blogger, Jekyll and self-hosted WordPress.
